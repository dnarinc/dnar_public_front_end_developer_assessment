# Exercise Front End Developer
This exercise focuses upon your ability to create a single page application from a list of requirements. In this exercise we want you to design and develop the following application design (fig. 1, fig. 2). We would like for you to stick to the core tech stack, but feel free to add others to accommodate. Feel free to add/modify anything you consider necessary to add value to the project, without messing with the main idea of the Web app. At Dnar, a common requirement for developers is to design systems to meet needs, and it's an expectation that our developers do so at a competent level.

## Delivery method
The way to deliver the solution of this exercise is by providing a link to the github repo housing the frontend code and link to deployed application(optional). 

## Core Technologies to be used:
* React.JS
* Redux
* ES6 Javascript
* API: [Coin Gecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api#explore-api) 



Please refer to these designs to build out your project:
